	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational that describes the time required to execute an algorithm.Most efficient time complexity because input size does not affect the algorithm's performance.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> O(n) refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.</p>
